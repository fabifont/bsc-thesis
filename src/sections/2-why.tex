\begin{frame}{Why it is used: the constructive way}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item combat fraud or credential hijacking
    \item suggest updates for out of date devices
    \item bot detection
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why it is used: the questionable way}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item track users across websites and collect information about their habits and their tastes without the users knowing about it:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Fingerprints as Global Identifiers:} if a device has a unique fingerprint, it is akin to a cookie that cannot be deleted
            \item \textbf{Fingerprint + IP address}
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{as Cookie Regenerators:} deleted cookies can be restored by matching the IP and the fingerprint
                    \item \textbf{in the absence of Cookies:} unmask different machines behind the same IP
                  \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Why it is used: advertising and customizing the online experience}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item data collected allows advertising businesses to create a custom profile for targeted advertising which indirectly means higher revenue for the company
    \item adapt content and prices due to users habits, status and location
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why it is used: the destructive way}
  Deliver exploits that are tailored for a specific user configuration
