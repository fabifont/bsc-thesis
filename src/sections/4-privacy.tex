\begin{frame}{What about privacy: GDPR and ePrivacy Directive}
  Since browser fingerprinting relies on the collection of personal data, companies using this technique must comply with the strict requirements of the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.
  That means that companies must be transparent about the data collection process and must ask for consent when personal data processing is involved.
  Otherwise, companies often have proprietary methods to perform browser fingerprinting and those are often hard to be detected.

\begin{frame}{What about privacy: prevention and mitigation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item use privacy-focused browsers like Tor and anti-fingerprinting extensions like Privacy-Badger and uBlock Origin
    \item disable unnecessary plugins, disable useless extensions and consider using default settings to blend in with a larger crowd
    \item keep the software updated
    \item if you are a developer, build your own anti-fingerprinting countermeasure
  \end{itemize}
