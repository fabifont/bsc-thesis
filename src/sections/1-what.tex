\begin{frame}{What is Browser Fingerprinting}
  Browser Fingerprinting, also known as Device Fingerprinting, is a sophisticated method that allows websites and online services to collect and analyze specific data about a user's device without relying on traditional tracking techniques like cookies or IP addresses. 
  When a user visits a website, their browser voluntarily shares certain configuration and setting details. 
  A server can collate this information, resulting in a unique fingerprint for the user's device.

\begin{frame}{Which data is collected}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Browser Info:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User Agent, Plugins, HTTP Accept Headers
        \item Cookie, Do Not Track, and Storage Settings
        \item WebGL Renderer, Canvas Fingerprinting
        \item WebRTC Leak, Navigator API Data
        \item Ad Blockers, Performance, Errors Handling
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Device Info:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Screen Resolution, Color Depth, Available Fonts
        \item Touch Support, Accelerometer, Gyroscope
        \item Audio Stack, CPU, Memory, Platform
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Network \& Session:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Time Zone, Language, Battery Status API
        \item Network Information, TLS/SSL Session IDs
        \item Active Media Queries, Mouse \& Event Capabilities
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Browser Fingerprinting properties: uniqueness} 
  It is highly improbable for two users to have identical fingerprints.
  In fact, studies have suggested the uniqueness can be so specific that only one in several hundred thousand users might share the same fingerprint.

\begin{frame}{Browser Fingerprinting properties: stateless}
  Even if users disable cookies or use privacy-focused browsing modes, fingerprinting can still function, making it both challenging to detect and thwart.
  Unlike cookies, this method is stateless, not relying on stored data in the browser, and hence, it leaves no obvious trace.
